## Wordle game demo

This is my solution to take-home challenge <a href="https://github.com/Rashedul007/wordle_rashed/issues/7">issue #7</a>, which is:

```
As a player, I want to see the correct letters highlighted so that I can narrow down my guesses. 

Highlight should indicate letters
- that are correct and in the right position
- that are correct but in the wrong position
```


> [!TIP]
> The fixed generated word I have used in the code is : ${\color{green}WORLD}$
